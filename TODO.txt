NOW
- more randomness in label id
- user fxcinspectionsed@gmail.com saw the warning only once? did the _CastError force him to log out and the warning then disappeared?

- computed properties with riverpod and fd? `select()`?
- update docs with latest releases

ISAR PROGRESS
 - need to determine serialization types
   - use jsonserializable ones? not trivial to get them
   - bypass jsonserializable completely and replicate isar serialization? more work, and converters of both json and isar in models
   - try to automate type discovery

CUSTOM ISAR, WHY?
 - can't use autoincrement with null IDs, because they could clash with remotes'
 - int? id can't be final?? how does it work with freezed?
 - doesnt play well with jsonserializable? what if string ids?
 - dynamic schemas
 - relationships don't notify, expensive to watch all collections (not lazily) to listen to what changed
 - automatic backlinks (except when can't detect inverse)
 - isarlinks is an iterable, works with freezed??
